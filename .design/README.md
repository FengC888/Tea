  <h1>tea design guidelines</h1>
  <p>We&#39;re calling on designers from our communi&#39;tea to help take our aesthetic to the next level! Whether you want to tackle some graphic design, UI/UX, or if you just have a small typographic nit&#8208;pick, we would be over the moon if you lent us your talents! This is a perfect opportunity for young designers who want experience working with style guides and larger teams. And for the seasoned designers out there, by all means, show is what you&#39;ve got!</p>

## Check out of style guide here:

Much like tea, our brand aesthetic is pushing the envelope of the design world. If you'd like to see for yourself, you can [download our style guide here](https://tea.xyz/Tea%20Brand%20Guidelines%20-%202022.pdf).

We use a visual grid system that defines the sizing of every element in the foreground, as well as typefaces that embody our core values and mission. The artwork you see throughout are website is generated with [AI (Stable Diffusion)](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream); if your contribution includes custom artwork, we recommend utilizing our prompt in order to best match the existing generations:

`focal point,  highly detailed, surrealism, #FF7BA7, #FF00FF, #2675F5, #29F746, #FFFF00, #FF8E00, smooth, sharp focus, matte, elegant, illustration, digital paint, sharp, dramatic lighting, beautiful, ambient lighting`

Prepend a unique prompt of your own to the text above and see what Stable Diffusion spits out!

## Types of contributions we accept:

Figma links, Illustrator/Photoshop files, PNG/SVG's for visual elements, MIRO boards, HTML files... whichever medium you feel you can make that greatest impact with, that's the one we want.

In terms of deciding *what* to contribute, you can audit our website and digital presence to find visual weak points, you can design new pages that you think augment the brand and messaging, or you can find a [design-related issue](https://github.com/teaxyz/www/issues) to tackle.

We want *everybody* to join our tea party and contribute to a better internet, so we're thrilled to be opening that up to designers.
